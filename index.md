## Welcome to GitHub Pages

I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at [San Diego State University](www.sdsu.edu). 

My current research focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms with a focus on problems that arise in streaming and distributed settings. Some topics include graph algorithms, approximation algorithms, and sketching algorithms. 

For more details, check out my research papers, CV, and Google Scholar. 

**Brief bio**: I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Andrew McGregor.  I also spent a year as a postdoc at Boston College, working with Prof. Hsin-Hao Su.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/hoavu123/hoavu123.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
